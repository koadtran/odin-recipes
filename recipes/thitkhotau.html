        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Thit Kho Tau is a quintessential Vietnamese home-cooked dish that you probably 
            won’t find in Vietnamese restaurants in the United States. The only way to enjoy it is to make it at home.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pork belly, pork shoulder, or a mix</li>
            <li>Fish sauce</li>
            <li>Nuoc mau</li>
            <li>Shallots and garlic</li>
            <li>Coconut water or coconut soda</li>
            <li>Eggs (chicken, duck, or quail)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by boiling the eggs. 
                Place them in a pot of water, bring to a boil, and cook for about 10 minutes. Once done, peel and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan over medium heat, add 3 tablespoons sugar evenly over the surface of the pan. Let it sit for 1-2 minutes without stirring. Once the sugar starts to melt, use a whisk or rubber spatula to stir constantly for 4-5 minutes (times will vary depending on your stovetop). Once melted and golden, carefully add ⅓ cup water to the caramel (it may bubble up), and stir to combine. Then remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add 2 pounds pork shoulder or pork belly, skin on or off and parboil for about 5 minutes to remove impurities. Drain the pork and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the parboiled pork with 1 teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon ground pepper, 3 tablespoons fish sauce, 3 tablespoons soy sauce (Maggi Seasoning Sauce), and 1-2 tablespoons caramel sauce you made earlier. Let the pork marinate for at least 15 minutes to absorb all the flavors.</li>
            <li>Heat ½ tablespoon olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the marinated pork in a single layer, working in batches if needed. Sear each side for 1–2 minutes until browned. Avoid overcrowding—the pork should sizzle, not steam. If it sticks, give it a moment; once it’s seared properly, it’ll release on its own. This step builds a ton of flavor, so don’t rush it.</li>
            <li>Add 2 shallots, finely diced and 3 garlic cloves, minced to the pot with the pork. Stir well and cook for another 2-3 minutes until fragrant and soft.</li>
            <li> Pour in 3 cups coconut soda and 1 cup water. Bring everything to a simmer, then lower the heat, cover, and let it braise for about 40 minutes. Stir occasionally and add a splash of water if it looks too dry. Once the pork is tender and the sauce has deepened in flavor, give it a taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.</li>
            <li>About 5–10 minutes before the pork is done, gently add the peeled hard-boiled eggs to the pot. Let them simmer so they warm up and soak in the rich, savory sauce. Even after you turn off the heat, the eggs will continue to absorb all that flavor.</li>
        </ol>
